A fully asynchronous [Couchbase Server](http://couchbase.com/) [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
Client based on [libcouchbase](https://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase).

> Important: This library is a work in progress and the API is subject to change (and it is not officially supported by Couchbase, Inc. at this point!).

# Usage

In your `Cargo.toml` use:

```toml
[dependencies]
couchbase = "0.3"
```

## Building
There are two options to build the SDK (or better, how to link the underlying)
`libcouchbase` library. If you run with all the default settings and just issue
a `cargo build`, the build file will use [cmake](https://cmake.org/) to actually
compile the library and link it out of the source tree. This has the benefit that
the SDK can compile against a specific version, making sure to not use invalid APIs
across versions.

If you want to force using a different libcouchbase version you can either fork
the code and plug in a different source tree, but the other option is to install
one on your machine and make it discoverable via `pkg-config`. If you set the
`COUCHBASE_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG` environment variable the build file will try to
discover both the library and its header files through `pkg-config` and there is
also no need to compile libcouchbase when doing so.

## Examples

Note that to run all the examples you need to run at least Rust 1.15.0 since
it supports custom derive on stable which `serde` needs. Run with
`cargo run --example=helloworld`.

```rust
extern crate couchbase;
extern crate futures;

use couchbase::{Cluster, Document};
use couchbase::document::BinaryDocument;
use futures::Future;

/// A very simple example which connects to the `default` bucket and writes and loads
/// a document.
fn main() {
    // Initialize the Cluster
    let mut cluster = Cluster::new("localhost").expect("Could not initialize Cluster");

    // If you auth with 5.0 / RBAC, use this:
    cluster.authenticate("Administrator", "password");

    // Open the travel-sample bucket
    let bucket = cluster
        .open_bucket("default", None)
        .expect("Could not open Bucket");

    // Create a document and store it in the bucket
    let document = BinaryDocument::create("hello", None, Some("abc".as_bytes().to_owned()), None);
    println!(
        "Wrote Document {:?}",
        bucket.upsert(document).wait().expect("Upsert failed!")
    );

    // Load the previously written document and print it out
    let document: BinaryDocument = bucket.get("hello").wait().expect("Could not load Document");
    println!("Found Document {:?}", document);
}
```
